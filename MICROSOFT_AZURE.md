## Microsoft Azure Interview Question 
* **What is cloud computing?**

  In the context of cloud computing, "cloud" refers to a network of remote servers that are hosted on the Internet and used to store, manage, and process data. These servers are typically housed in data centers operated by cloud service providers. The term "cloud" is derived from the use of a cloud symbol in network diagrams to represent the internet.

  On the other hand, "computing" refers to the use of computers or computer systems to perform various tasks and processes, including data processing, storage, analysis, and communication. Computing involves the execution of instructions or algorithms by hardware and software components to manipulate and transform data into useful information.

  When combined, **cloud computing** refers to the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, software, and networking, over the internet. It involves accessing and utilizing these services remotely, without the need for local infrastructure or hardware. Cloud computing allows users to leverage the capabilities of remote servers and resources for running applications, storing and retrieving data, and performing computational tasks. It provides a flexible and scalable computing environment that can be accessed from anywhere, providing convenience, cost efficiency, and ease of management.

  **The key characteristics of cloud computing include:**

      1. On-Demand Self-Service:- Access computing resources such as processing power, storage, and networking, as needed without requiring human interaction with service providers.
      2. Broad Network Access:- Cloud services can be accessed over the internet via various devices, including laptops, tablets, smartphones, or specialized terminals.
      3. Resource Pooling:- Computing resources are pooled together to serve multiple users simultaneously, allowing for efficient utilization and scalability. Users typically have no control or knowledge over the exact location of the resources.
      4. Rapid Elasticity: Cloud services can quickly scale up or down based on demand. Resources can be allocated or released dynamically to match the changing needs of the users, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.
      5. Measured Service: Cloud providers monitor and track resource usage, providing transparency and allowing for pay-per-use or subscription-based billing models. Users only pay for the resources they consume.

      **Summary** 
      1. On-Demand Self-Service --> Access computing services when needed without requiring humans.
      2. Broad Network Access:- access anywhere via the Internet like a mobile, or tablet.
      3. Resource Pooling:- Multiple users can access.
      4. Rapid Elasticity:- Up or down as per need.
      5. Measured Service:- Everything is tracked.


* **What is Microsoft Azure, and what are its key components?**
