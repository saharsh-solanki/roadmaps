* **What is the history of python?**
* **Zen of python** ( it's for fun.)
    ```
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

* **What is PEP8?**

    PEP8 is a coding style guide for Python programming. PEP stands for "Python Enhancement Proposal," which is a document that proposes and describes new features or improvements to the Python language.

    PEP 8 specifically focuses on the style and formatting of Python code to enhance its readability and maintainability. It provides guidelines and conventions for naming conventions, code layout, comments, and other aspects of Python code.

* **What is a Python decorator?**

    In Python, a decorator is a design pattern that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or classes without directly modifying their source code. It is a higher-order function that takes in a function or class as input and returns a new function or class with added functionality.
